    <h3> "The litle secret place where you can find the most delicious <em>Greek</em> and <em>Cretan</em> recipes." - Gordon Ramsay </h3>

    <p>"The luscious Cretan cuisine has been associated with health since the early 60s,
         due to the Seven Countries Study, a study that showed Cretans having the best health 
         conditions and the lower rates ofcoronary heart disease and cancer mortality than all 
         other populations studied." </p>

    <p>"Although rich in flavor, the Cretan cuisine is rather sparing regarding its variety of ingredients. 
        The traditional dishes of Crete can be cooked with just a handful of products, with the flavorsome
         result being achieved through the art of processing simple materials, rather than through the
          concoction of intricate food combinations. Now that we’ve waxed lyrical about the unmatched value of it,
           it’s time for you to get a practical insight into this unique cuisine.
         Here, we have gathered our favorite Cretan recipes that you absolutely need to try." </p>
